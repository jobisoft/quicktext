[Quicktext](https://addons.thunderbird.net/addon/quicktext/) is a [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/) extension, which has been created by Emil Hesslow. However, he was no longer able to update Quicktext or provide any kind of support. Thankfully he changed the license of Quicktext (and Quicktext Pro) to MPL 2.0 and shared its sources with the Thunderbird project, so others could update the extension to make it work with the most recent version of Thunderbird.

Volunteers will try to keep Quicktext going, but support will be limited. You may use the [issue section](https://github.com/thundernest/quicktext/issues) of this repository to report bugs, but do not expect fast responses. You may also discuss Quicktext related issues with other users at https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/thunderbird.

**Note**: Emil maintained two versions of Quicktext, a free "Standard" version and a paid "Pro" version with additional features. Since he released both versions under MPL 2.0, the Thunderbird Council decided to base the [official version of Quicktext](https://addons.thunderbird.net/addon/quicktext/) on the "Pro" version. However, the name of the extension remains just "Quicktext". There is no longer a seperate Quicktext Pro version.
